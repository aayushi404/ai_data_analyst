Here is a structured, step-by-step plan to address your request:

### **Step 1: Data Extraction**

This initial step focuses on retrieving the raw data from the specified Wikipedia page.

*   **Sub-step 1.1: Accessing the URL:**
    *   **Action:** Make an HTTP request to the provided URL: `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films`.use requests library with user agent to fetch the HTML content of the page.use agent should be 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/125.0.0.0 Safari/537.36'\n" 
    *   **Tool:** A library for making HTTP requests, such as Python's `requests` library.

*   **Sub-step 1.2: Parsing the HTML Content:**
    *   **Action:** Parse the HTML content of the page to locate the main table containing the list of highest-grossing films.
    *   **Tool:** A library for parsing HTML, such as Python's `BeautifulSoup` or `lxml`.

*   **Sub-step 1.3: Identifying and Extracting the Table:**
    *   **Action:** Pinpoint the correct table within the HTML structure. This is typically done by inspecting the page's source code to find unique identifiers for the table, such as an ID or a specific class. The primary table of interest is the one titled "Highest-grossing films".
    *   **Tool:** HTML parsing library (e.g., `BeautifulSoup`) combined with a library that can directly read HTML tables into a structured format, like Python's `pandas`.

### **Step 2: Data Cleaning and Transformation**

Once the raw data is extracted, it needs to be cleaned and formatted to facilitate analysis.

*   **Sub-step 2.1: Converting to a DataFrame:**
    *   **Action:** Convert the extracted HTML table into a pandas DataFrame for easier manipulation.
    *   **Tool:** Python's `pandas` library.

*   **Sub-step 2.2: Data Type Conversion and Cleaning:**
    *   **Action:**
        *   Convert the 'Worldwide gross' column from a string with currency symbols and text (e.g., "$2,974,839,111") to a numerical format (e.g., 2974839111). This will involve removing characters like '$', ',', and any bracketed annotations.
        *   Convert the 'Year' column to a numeric or datetime format to enable filtering by date.
        *   Ensure the 'Rank' and 'Peak' columns are treated as numerical data for correlation and plotting.
    *   **Tool:** Python's `pandas` library, utilizing string manipulation functions (`.str.replace()`) and data type conversion methods (`.astype()`).

### **Step 3: Answering the Questions**

With the data cleaned and prepared, the final step is to perform the analysis to answer each specific question.

*   **Answering Question 1: How many $2 bn movies were released before 2000?**
    *   **Sub-step 3.1.1:** Filter the DataFrame to include only films with a 'Worldwide gross' greater than or equal to $2,000,000,000.
    *   **Sub-step 3.1.2:** From the filtered data, further filter for films with a 'Year' before 2000.
    *   **Sub-step 3.1.3:** Count the number of rows in the resulting DataFrame.
    *   **Tool:** Python's `pandas` library for data filtering and counting.

*   **Answering Question 2: Which is the earliest film that grossed over $1.5 bn?**
    *   **Sub-step 3.2.1:** Filter the DataFrame to select films where the 'Worldwide gross' is greater than or equal to $1,500,000,000.
    *   **Sub-step 3.2.2:** Sort the filtered DataFrame by the 'Year' column in ascending order.
    *   **Sub-step 3.2.3:** Select the 'Title' of the first film in the sorted list.
    *   **Tool:** Python's `pandas` library for filtering and sorting data.

*   **Answering Question 3: What's the correlation between the Rank and Peak?**
    *   **Sub-step 3.3.1:** Select the 'Rank' and 'Peak' columns from the cleaned DataFrame.
    *   **Sub-step 3.3.2:** Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between these two columns.
    *   **Tool:** Python's `pandas` or `scipy.stats` library to compute the correlation.

*   **Answering Question 4: Draw a scatterplot of Rank and Peak along with a dotted red regression line.**
    *   **Sub-step 3.4.1:** Create a scatterplot using the 'Rank' as the x-axis and 'Peak' as the y-axis.
    *   **Sub-step 3.4.2:** Calculate a line of best fit (linear regression) for the data.
    *   **Sub-step 3.4.3:** Overlay the regression line onto the scatterplot, styling it as a dotted red line.
    *   **Sub-step 3.4.4:** Save the resulting plot to an in-memory buffer.
    *   **Sub-step 3.4.5:** Encode the image from the buffer into a base64 data URI string.
    *   **Tools:** Python's `matplotlib` and `seaborn` libraries for plotting, `scikit-learn` or `numpy` for the regression line, and the `base64` library for encoding.
